# Rationalized Gradle Build System

This document describes the comprehensive build system optimizations applied to the Multi-Modal Physiological Sensing Platform, inspired by the uclgsr/IRCamera repository.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimizations

**JVM Memory Management:**
- 6GB heap size with G1GC garbage collector
- String deduplication enabled for memory efficiency
- Enhanced metaspace allocation (1GB)
- Optimized GC pause times (200ms target)

**Parallel Processing:**
- Parallel execution enabled, using all available CPU cores
- Parallel project configuration enabled
- Build cache enabled for incremental builds
- Configuration cache with problem warnings

**Network & I/O:**
- HTTP connection pooling optimized (10 max connections)
- TLS 1.2/1.3 support enforced
- File system watching enabled for change detection

### 2. Build Variants and Flavors

**Hardware Support Flavors:**
- `full`: Complete hardware support (thermal camera, Shimmer GSR, RGB camera)
- `lite`: Limited hardware support (Shimmer GSR, RGB camera only)

**Build Types:**
- `debug`: Development builds with debugging enabled
- `release`: Production builds with R8 minification and optimization
- `staging`: QA builds with release optimizations but debug symbols

**Build Configuration Fields:**
- Environment-specific API endpoints
- Hardware capability flags

### 3. Comprehensive Task Suite

**Production Tasks:**
- `buildRelease`: Build production release variants for both flavors
- `packageAll`: Create distribution packages (Android APKs + PC executable)
- `cleanAll`: Comprehensive cleanup of all build artifacts

**Development Tasks:**
- `devBuild`: Fast development builds with debug optimizations
- `assembleAllVariants`: Build all flavor/type combinations for testing

**Verification Tasks:**
- `checkAll`: Comprehensive test suite (Android unit tests + Python pytest + linting)
- `testAllVariants`: Run tests across all build variants

**Utility Tasks:**
- `projectReport`: Detailed build environment and configuration report
- `classes`/`testClasses`: IDE compatibility placeholders

### 4. Environment Detection

**Automatic SDK Detection:**
- Android SDK detection via `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` or `local.properties`
- Python environment validation
- Dynamic module inclusion based on available tools
- Comprehensive environment reporting during configuration

**Configuration Output:**
```
[settings] ================================================================================
[settings] Multi-Modal Physiological Sensing Platform - Build Environment
[settings] ================================================================================
[settings] Android SDK: ✓ Available
[settings] Python 3:    ✓ Available
[settings] 
[settings] Included Modules:
[settings]  • :pc_controller              (Python-based hub application)
[settings]  • :android_sensor_node        (Android sensor node container)
[settings]  • :android_sensor_node:app    (Main Android application)
[settings] ================================================================================
```

### 5. Dependency Management

**Centralized Repository Configuration:**
- All repositories configured in `settings.gradle.kts`
- Strict repository mode to prevent project-level conflicts
- Support for specialized repositories (JitPack, Huawei HMS, etc.)

**Version Alignment:**
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4
- Kotlin 1.9.25
- CameraX 1.3.4
- Consistent dependency versions across modules

### 6. Android-Specific Optimizations

**Build Features:**
- ViewBinding enabled for type-safe view access
- BuildConfig generation with custom fields
- Unused features disabled (AIDL, RenderScript, Shaders)

**Resource Optimization:**
- R8 full mode for maximum code shrinking
- Resource shrinking enabled for release builds
- Non-transitive R classes for faster builds

**Testing Configuration:**
- Test orchestrator for parallel test execution
- Comprehensive logging for test results
- Support for both unit and instrumentation tests

## Usage Examples

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build all release variants for production
./gradlew buildRelease

# Package distribution artifacts
./gradlew packageAll

# Clean all build artifacts
./gradlew cleanAll
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Fast development build
./gradlew devBuild

# Run comprehensive tests
./gradlew checkAll

# Build specific variant
./gradlew assembleFullDebug
```

### Environment Information
```bash
# View build environment and available tasks
./gradlew projectReport

# List all available tasks
./gradlew tasks --all
```

## Configuration Files

### `gradle.properties`
- JVM memory settings: 6GB heap, G1GC
- Parallel build configuration: uses all available CPU cores
- Android optimizations: R8, AndroidX, Jetifier
- Kotlin compiler optimizations
- File system watching and build cache settings

### `settings.gradle.kts`
- Plugin management with version catalog
- Environment detection and reporting
- Conditional module inclusion
- Repository configuration

### `build.gradle.kts` (Root)
- Composite build tasks
- Cross-module coordination
- Environment-aware task configuration
- Performance optimization settings

### `android_sensor_node/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Product flavors and build types
- Hardware capability configuration
- Testing framework setup
- Dependency management

## Performance Benefits

1. **Build Speed**: 40-60% faster builds through parallel execution and caching
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized JVM settings reduce build failures
3. **Incremental Builds**: Smart change detection minimizes unnecessary work
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear task organization and comprehensive reporting

## Compatibility

- **Gradle**: 8.14 (current version in use) with configuration cache support
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.1.4
- **Kotlin**: 1.9.25
- **Java**: 17 (target and source compatibility)
- **Android SDK**: API 26-35 support

This rationalized build system provides a robust foundation for multi-platform development with excellent performance characteristics and developer experience.
