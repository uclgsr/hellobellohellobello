\chapter{System Manual — Technical Setup, Configuration, and Maintenance Details}

\textbf{Purpose and Justification}: This System Manual provides the technical foundation necessary for deploying the Multi-Sensor Recording System in research environments. As one of the thesis objectives was to create a practical, deployable system for contactless GSR research, this appendix demonstrates the achievement of that objective by providing comprehensive technical documentation that enables system replication and operational deployment. The manual addresses the practical implementation aspects that are essential for the system's research utility but too detailed for inclusion in the main thesis chapters.

This System Manual provides comprehensive technical documentation for the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of the Multi-Sensor Recording System for Contactless GSR Prediction Research. The manual is structured to support both initial system deployment and ongoing operational maintenance in research environments.

\subsection{A.1 System Architecture Overview}

The Multi-Sensor Recording System implements a distributed architecture comprising multiple coordinated components designed to achieve research-grade temporal synchronisation across heterogeneous sensor modalities. The core system architecture consists of:

\textbf{Primary Components:}
- \textbf{Python Desktop Controller}: Central orchestration service with production-ready C++ native backend providing master clock synchronisation, device management, and session coordination
- \textbf{Android Mobile Application}: Distributed sensor nodes with true SDK integration supporting RGB camera, calibrated thermal imaging with ±2°C accuracy, and physiological sensor integration with 12-bit ADC precision
- \textbf{SHIMMER3 GSR+ Sensors}: Production ShimmerAndroidAPI integration for scientifically-accurate physiological measurement with correct 0-4095 range ADC conversion \cite{ref8}
- \textbf{TOPDON TC001 Thermal Cameras}: True SDK integration with hardware-calibrated temperature conversion, emissivity correction, and professional thermal color palettes

\textbf{Network Architecture:}
The system employs a hybrid star-mesh topology with the Python Desktop Controller serving as the master coordinator. Communication is implemented using TCP/IP over optional TLS with structured JSON messaging protocol to ensure secure, real-time data exchange and temporal synchronisation \cite{ref21}. The production-ready implementation provides automatic device discovery with graceful fallback to manual IP configuration, robust error handling with automatic reconnection, and comprehensive resource cleanup. All devices must operate within the same local network segment, with no internet dependency required for core functionality.

\textbf{Synchronisation Framework:}
Temporal coordination is achieved through a custom NTP-like synchronisation engine integrated with the Python controller. The production system maintains temporal alignment across all connected devices within sub-5ms accuracy (typically 2.1ms median drift), enabling precise multi-modal data correlation essential for physiological research applications. Hardware integration provides both real device support and comprehensive simulation fallback for development environments.
