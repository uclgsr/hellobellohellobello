\chapter{Consolidated Figures, Diagrams, and Visual Content}

\textbf{Purpose and Justification}: This appendix consolidates all figures, diagrams, tables, and visual content referenced throughout the Multi-Sensor Recording System thesis. By centralising visual materials, this appendix enables efficient cross-referencing while maintaining narrative flow in the main chapters. The consolidation demonstrates the comprehensive nature of the visual documentation supporting the research while providing a single reference point for all graphical content.

% NOTE: Content preserved via verbatim for speed and fidelity. TODO: Convert key tables to LaTeX tabular and render Mermaid to static images for print in a later pass.

% Rendered Mermaid examples (compiled by LaTeX). See README for build requirements.
