### 4. üìä **Data Export Pipeline** (`data_pipeline/`)
**What was missing:** Complete data processing and analysis integration pipeline
**Now includes:**
- End-to-end data flow from raw sensor data to analysis tools
- Multiple export format support (HDF5, CSV, MATLAB, Python)
- Quality assurance and validation steps
- Integration with external analysis platforms
- Archival and backup procedures
- Data provenance tracking

**Export formats visualized:**
- HDF5 (basic & production), CSV unified, MATLAB .mat files
- Integration with MATLAB, Python SciPy, R analysis tools

### 5. üîó **External Integrations** (`integrations/`)
**What was missing:** Integration with external research tools and APIs
**Now includes:**
- Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) real-time streaming
- Hardware API integrations (Shimmer SDK, Topdon SDK, CameraX)
- Analysis tool connections (MATLAB Engine, Python SciPy, R)
- Cloud storage and backup services
