### Sample Size Limitations
- **User Testing:** n=3 limits generalizability (qualitative insights primary)
- **Reliability Analysis:** Limited failure events reduce MTBF precision
- **Long-term Trends:** 8-hour maximum testing may miss extended patterns

### Statistical Power Considerations
- **Type II Error Risk:** User testing underpowered for some comparisons
- **Multiple Comparisons:** Bonferroni correction applied where appropriate
