[2024-12-10 14:23:45.567] CRITICAL Qt Threading Error
ERROR: QApplication: Cannot modify widget from worker thread
Thread ID: 0x7f8b2c001700 (DeviceManager worker thread)
Widget: QLabel (device_status_label)
Stack Trace:
  File "pc_controller/src/gui/gui_manager.py", line 234, in update_device_status
    self.device_status_label.setText(f"Connected: {device_count}")
  File "pc_controller/src/network/device_manager.py", line 89, in scan_network
    self.gui_manager.update_device_status(len(self.connected_devices))
  File "pc_controller/src/network/device_manager.py", line 156, in _scan_worker_thread
    self.scan_network()

CAUSE: Direct GUI manipulation from non-main thread
IMPACT: Application freeze for 3.7 seconds, user interface unresponsive
FREQUENCY: 12 occurrences during testing period

[2024-12-11 09:45:23.123] CRITICAL Qt Threading Error
ERROR: QPixmap: It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread
Thread ID: 0x7f8b2c002800 (PreviewManager worker thread)
Widget: QLabel (camera_preview_label)
Stack Trace:
  File "pc_controller/src/gui/preview_manager.py", line 167, in update_preview_display
    pixmap = QPixmap.fromImage(qt_image)
  File "pc_controller/src/gui/preview_manager.py", line 189, in _process_frame_worker
    self.update_preview_display(processed_frame)

CAUSE: QPixmap creation outside main GUI thread
IMPACT: Application crash - segmentation fault
FREQUENCY: 8 occurrences, 3 resulted in complete application crash

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[2024-12-12 16:12:34.789] WARNING Threading Performance Issue
WARNING: Blocking operation detected on main UI thread
Thread ID: 0x7f8b2c000100 (Main GUI thread)
Operation: Network socket connection attempt
Duration: 5.234 seconds
Stack Trace:
  File "pc_controller/src/gui/main_window.py", line 145, in on_connect_button_clicked
    result = self.device_manager.scan_network()
  File "pc_controller/src/network/device_manager.py", line 78, in scan_network
    sock.connect((ip, 8443))  # Blocking I/O call

CAUSE: Synchronous network I/O on main thread
IMPACT: UI freeze during network operations, poor user experience
FREQUENCY: 23 occurrences during normal operation

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[2024-12-13 11:27:56.456] CRITICAL Application Crash
ERROR: Segmentation fault in Qt event loop
Process terminated unexpectedly
Signal: SIGSEGV (11)
Core dump: core.12345
Last operation: Camera preview update from worker thread

Thread Analysis from Core Dump:
- Main thread: Waiting in QEventLoop::exec()
- Worker thread 1: Crashed during QLabel::setPixmap() call
- Worker thread 2: Blocked on network socket
- Worker thread 3: Processing video frame data

CAUSE: Race condition between main thread and preview worker thread
IMPACT: Complete application crash, data loss risk
RECOVERY: Automatic restart failed, manual restart required

====================================================================
THREADING MODEL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
====================================================================

Issue 1: Direct GUI Manipulation from Worker Threads
- Affected Components: DeviceManager, PreviewManager, DataExporter
- Root Cause: Bypassing Qt's Signal/Slot mechanism
- Severity: CRITICAL
- Occurrences: 47 incidents over 5 days

Issue 2: Blocking I/O Operations on Main Thread
- Affected Components: Network connection, file I/O operations
- Root Cause: Synchronous operations in GUI event handlers
- Severity: HIGH
- Impact: UI responsiveness severely degraded

Issue 3: Shared Resource Access Without Proper Locking
- Affected Components: Session data structures, device lists
- Root Cause: Multiple threads accessing shared data concurrently
- Severity: MEDIUM
- Manifestation: Occasional data corruption, inconsistent UI state

Issue 4: Improper Thread Lifecycle Management
- Affected Components: Worker thread creation and cleanup
- Root Cause: Missing thread.quit() and thread.wait() calls
- Severity: MEDIUM
- Impact: Resource leaks, zombie threads

====================================================================
PERFORMANCE IMPACT ANALYSIS
====================================================================

User Experience Degradation:
- Average UI freeze duration: 2.8 seconds per incident
- Application crashes per 8-hour session: 1.4
- Time lost to manual restarts: 47 minutes over 5 days
- User frustration incidents: 31 (significant workflow interruption)

System Resource Impact:
- Memory leaks from improper thread cleanup: 23.7 MB over 8 hours
- CPU usage spikes during threading conflicts: up to 89% utilization
- Thread count growth: 12 â†’ 47 threads over extended usage

====================================================================
CURRENT WORKAROUNDS DEPLOYED
====================================================================

1. Automatic Application Restart Script
   - Monitors for crashes via process watchdog
   - Automatically restarts application after crash
   - Success rate: 78% (manual intervention still required 22% of time)

2. UI Thread Checker (Development Build Only)
   - Runtime detection of GUI access from wrong threads
   - Logs violations for debugging
   - Performance overhead: ~3% CPU usage

3. Reduced Threading for Critical Operations
   - Disabled multi-threaded preview updates
   - Synchronous network operations only
   - Trade-off: Improved stability but reduced performance

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
====================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Implement proper Signal/Slot communication for all GUI updates
2. Move all blocking I/O operations to dedicated worker threads
3. Add proper synchronization primitives for shared data access
4. Implement graceful thread shutdown procedures

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extended stress testing with thread sanitizers enabled
2. Multi-device concurrent testing for race condition detection
3. Memory leak analysis with extended 24-hour runs

MONITORING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Production deployment should include crash reporting
2. Thread health monitoring and alerting
3. Automatic restart capability with session recovery
