## Session 1: Initial System Setup (P1 - New User)

**Date:** December 10, 2024, 2:00 PM
**Duration:** 18 minutes 34 seconds
**Task:** Complete first-time system setup and establish device connections

### Timeline and Observations:

**0:00-2:15** - PC Application Launch
- P1 successfully launched PC controller application
- Initial confusion about which executable to run ("Why are there so many .py files?")
- Required verbal guidance to locate main application

**2:15-5:45** - Android Device Setup
- Downloaded and installed Android app without issues
- Struggled with enabling "Unknown Sources" for APK installation
- Quote: "I don't understand why this isn't in the Play Store"
- Eventually successful with step-by-step guidance

**5:45-12:20** - Network Connection Configuration
- **MAJOR FRICTION POINT:** Manual IP address entry
- P1 required multiple attempts to determine PC IP address
- Typed IP incorrectly 3 times: "192.168.1.105" -> "192.168.1.15" -> "192.168.1.150" -> correct
- Quote: "Can't this just find it automatically? Every other app does."
- Connection successful after IP correction

**12:20-15:10** - Device Registration Process
- Android device registered successfully on first attempt
- P1 appreciated the visual feedback of connection status
- Minor confusion about sensor selection (RGB vs RGB+GSR options)

**15:10-18:34** - First Recording Test
- Successfully started and stopped a 30-second test recording
- P1 worried about file location: "Where did the video go?"
- Required guidance to locate exported files
- Overall success but with significant hand-holding

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Network Discovery:** Manual IP entry is major barrier for non-technical users
2. **File Management:** Export location not intuitive
3. **Installation Process:** APK sideloading creates friction
4. **Documentation:** Quick start guide needed for first-time users

- Quote: "This is much more flexible than [competitor system]"

**3:30-6:00** - Sensor Integration Exploration
- Attempted to configure Shimmer GSR sensor
- **LIMITATION DISCOVERED:** Real hardware integration not available
- P3 understood simulation limitations but noted: "The interface looks ready for real sensors"
- Suggested specific improvements for hardware integration workflow

**6:00-8:12** - Data Export and Analysis
- Successfully exported data in multiple formats (CSV, HDF5, MP4)
- Appreciated timestamp synchronization preservation
- **FEATURE REQUEST:** Integration with MATLAB/Python analysis tools
