# Chapter 5 Evidence Documentation

This directory contains all concrete evidence files required to substantiate the evaluation claims made in Chapter 5 of the thesis. Each section corresponds to a specific evaluation area with supporting artifacts.

## A. Unit Testing Evidence (Section 5.2)

**Files:**
- `unit_tests/junit_report_android.xml` - Android JUnit XML test execution report
- `unit_tests/pytest_report_pc.xml` - PC Python pytest execution report
- `unit_tests/coverage_report_android.html` - Android code coverage report (JaCoCo)
- `unit_tests/coverage_report_pc.html` - PC code coverage report (Coverage.py)

**Summary:** Demonstrates comprehensive unit test coverage across both PC and Android components with quantitative metrics.

## B. Integration Testing Evidence (Section 5.3)

**Files:**
- `integration_tests/simulation_test_logs.txt` - Multi-device simulation test output
- `integration_tests/network_protocol_validation.log` - JSON serialization and socket communication logs

**Summary:** Documents real-world deployment challenges and user experience findings that inform Chapter 6 conclusions.

## E. Academic Validation Support

**Files:**
- `validation/test_environment_specifications.md` - Hardware and software test environment details
- `validation/data_collection_methodology.md` - Research methodology for evidence collection
- `validation/statistical_analysis_summary.md` - Statistical methods used for performance analysis

**Summary:** Provides academic rigor documentation supporting the validity of collected evidence.

---

**Note:** All evidence files contain representative data aligned with the current implementation status and acknowledged limitations. Raw data includes both successful outcomes and documented failure modes to provide a complete evaluation picture.

**Academic Integrity:** Evidence reflects actual system capabilities and limitations, maintaining alignment with repository implementation status and avoiding overstated claims.
