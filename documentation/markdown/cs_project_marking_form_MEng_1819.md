> ***INSTRUCTIONS:** Use the General Comments box to note the particular
> strengths and weaknesses of the project, and any factors that are not*
> covered by the rest of the form. Fill in a (%) mark for each of the
> four key areas, see overleaf for more guidance on mark ranges.
> Underline or highlight key phrases in the descriptions that apply to
> this project including those overleaf. Fill in an overall (%) mark
> averaging the four key area marks. The project supervisor (if one of
> the markers) should also grade the student on their independence
> (Grades A to F). All parts of the form should be filled in. If the
> first and second markers cannot agree a mark, tick the Request Third
> Marker box and omit an Agreed Mark. If the initial marks differ by
> more than 15% the Request Third Marker box should also be ticked, even
> if there is an Agreed Mark.
