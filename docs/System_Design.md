## High-Level Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

The system employs a **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** with a central PC acting as the "Hub" and multiple Android devices functioning as mobile sensor "Spokes."

**Architectural Benefits:**
- **Centralized Control**: Single PC Hub provides unified interface for session management
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates multiple Android spokes without architectural changes
- **Modularity**: Hub and Spokes are distinct, self-contained applications
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operation if individual spokes fail
