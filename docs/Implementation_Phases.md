## Phase Dependencies and Timeline

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Basic communication required before sensor integration
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Local recording must work before advanced networking
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Synchronization needed for GUI session management  
4. **Phase 4 → Phase 5**: Complete GUI required for integration testing
5. **Phase 5 → Phase 6**: All features must be integrated before optimization

### Parallel Development Opportunities

- **Phase 2 Tasks**: Different sensor modules can be developed concurrently
- **Phase 4 Tasks**: GUI components can be developed in parallel with backend
- **Phase 5 Tasks**: Testing and documentation can overlap with feature development

### Quality Gates

Each phase includes validation criteria that must be met before proceeding:
- **Unit tests** passing for all new components
- **Integration tests** validating phase objectives  
- **Code review** and documentation completion
- **Performance benchmarks** meeting requirements

This phased approach ensures systematic development with clear milestones, proper validation at each stage, and minimal risk of integration issues. Each phase builds incrementally toward a complete, production-ready research platform.
