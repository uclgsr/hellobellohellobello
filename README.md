# Multi-Modal Physiological Sensing Platform

This repository contains a hub-and-spoke research platform for synchronous, multi-modal data collection.

- Hub (PC Controller, Python + PyQt6): Central controller for session management, device control, data aggregation,
  playback/annotation, and export to HDF5. Performance-critical components are bridged via a C++ native backend (
  PyBind11).
- Spoke (Android Sensor Node, Kotlin/Android): Mobile client that interfaces with hardware (RGB, thermal, Shimmer GSR),
  records locally, and communicates with the Hub over a secured TCP/IP socket.

See docs/1_high_level_design.md and docs/2_detail_design.md for design overviews, and docs/3_phase_by_phase.md with the
phase-specific implementation notes.

## Project Structure

- pc_controller/ — Python sources, native backend (C++), tests, and Gradle tasks for Python workflows
- android_sensor_node/ — Android application (MVVM), with CameraX RGB, Topdon TC001 thermal integration, and Shimmer GSR
- docs/ — User and developer documentation, protocol, validation guides, and LaTeX sources
- scripts/ — Utility scripts (e.g., backup_script.py)

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 for the packaged PC Controller EXE (PyInstaller). Python 3.11+ for development.
- Android Studio (Giraffe/Koala or newer), Android SDK/NDK as required by your environment.
- Git and Java 17+ for Gradle builds.

## Building and Running

### PC Controller (Hub)

- Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
    - From repository root: `gradlew.bat :pc_controller:installRequirements` (creates pc_controller/.venv and installs
      deps)
- Run tests: `gradlew.bat :pc_controller:pyTest` or simply `pytest` from the repo root (pytest.ini is configured)
- Package EXE: `gradlew.bat :pc_controller:assemblePcController`
    - Output is placed under pc_controller/build/dist/pc_controller.exe

To run from sources (development):

- Activate the venv: `pc_controller\.venv\Scripts\activate`
- Launch: `python pc_controller\src\main.py`

### Android Sensor Node (Spoke)

- Open the project in Android Studio at the repository root (multi-project Gradle). The Android module is at
  android_sensor_node/app.
- Build debug: `gradlew.bat :android_sensor_node:app:assembleDebug`
- Unit tests: `gradlew.bat :android_sensor_node:app:testDebugUnitTest`
- Release APK: `gradlew.bat :android_sensor_node:app:assembleRelease`

> Note: Building the Android module requires a properly configured Android SDK/NDK in your environment.

### Aggregate Tasks

- Run both Python and Android unit tests: `gradlew.bat checkAll`
- Package PC EXE and Android APK: `gradlew.bat packageAll`

## Communication and Time Sync

- **Enterprise TLS Security**: TLS 1.2+ TCP/IP socket with mutual authentication and secure message framing. See docs/TLS_API_Documentation.md for comprehensive security configuration.
- **Fault Tolerance System**: Automatic heartbeat monitoring with device health tracking and exponential backoff reconnection. See docs/Heartbeat_API_Documentation.md for implementation details.
- **NTP-like Time Sync**: Handshake upon connection to compute per-device clock offsets. All data is timestamped using device-local monotonic clocks; alignment is performed in post-processing.
- **Flash Sync**: The Hub can broadcast a `flash_sync` command to trigger simultaneous on-screen flashes across devices for temporal validation (docs/Flash_Sync_Validation.md).

## Data Handling

- Android records locally per session (RGB MP4 + FR5 JPEGs, thermal CSV, GSR CSV). On stop, the device can transfer a
  ZIP of the session to the Hub over TCP.
- On PC, DataLoader and HDF5 exporter utilities aggregate and export into a research-ready HDF5 file.
- Backup strategy and automation: see BACKUP_STRATEGY.md and scripts/backup_script.py.

## Native Backend

- pc_controller/native_backend contains the C++ code intended for PyBind11 integration for high-performance capture (
  Shimmer via Shimmer C-API and local webcam via OpenCV). Consult pc_controller/native_backend/README.md for build
  guidance.

## Security & Ethics

- **Production Security**: Enterprise-grade TLS encryption with certificate-based authentication, comprehensive input validation, and security hardening. See docs/Production_Deployment_Guide.md for security configuration.
- **Data Protection**: Local recording with optional encrypted transfer and secure data handling throughout the pipeline.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Designed for research environments with appropriate consent and data protection procedures.

- Android local storage is encrypted using Android Keystore (AES256-GCM) for sensitive artifacts. The PC Controller
  requires authentication (see GUI docs) and supports anonymized participant IDs.
- Face blurring is available in video streams to protect privacy (see GUI playback tools in docs).

## Testing

- Python unit tests use pytest (see pytest.ini; tests located under pc_controller/tests). Run via `pytest` or Gradle
  task `:pc_controller:pyTest`.
- Android unit tests use JUnit; invoke via `:android_sensor_node:app:testDebugUnitTest`.
- System-level validation for temporal accuracy is described in docs/Flash_Sync_Validation.md.

## Contributing

- Follow Conventional Commits. Update CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog) under the Unreleased section for every change.
- Branching model: main (stable), develop (integration), feat/... for features.

# Getting Started (Cross-Platform)

This section provides a simple, step-by-step path for new users and examiners to install dependencies, run a basic session, and execute validation scripts.

## PC Controller Environment Setup
- Install Python 3.11+
- (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
  - Windows (PowerShell):
    - python -m venv .venv
    - .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  - macOS/Linux (bash):
    - python3 -m venv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate
- Install Python dependencies:
  - pip install -r pc_controller/requirements.txt

## Android Sensor Node (APK Build in Android Studio)
1. Open Android Studio and choose "Open" then select this repository root.
2. Ensure the Android module is at android_sensor_node/app.
3. Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled.
4. Build and run:
   - Debug build: Gradle task :android_sensor_node:app:assembleDebug, or press Run in Android Studio.
   - Release APK: Gradle task :android_sensor_node:app:assembleRelease (signing config required).

## Quick Start (Run a Basic Recording Session)
1. Launch the PC Controller from sources:
   - Windows: python pc_controller\src\main.py
   - macOS/Linux: python3 pc_controller/src/main.py
2. Ensure your Android device(s) are on the same network as the PC.
3. Start the Android app; wait until it appears in the PC Controller device list.
4. Create a new session in the PC Controller (e.g., TEST_<date>).
5. Click Start Recording to begin a synchronized session.
6. Record for ~30 seconds, then click Stop Recording.
7. After stop, confirm the session folder under pc_controller_data/<SESSION_ID> contains metadata.json and incoming files from devices.

## Run System Verification Tests
- Automated (pytest):
  - pytest -q pc_controller/tests/test_system_end_to_end.py
  - These tests validate FR4 (Session Management) and FR1 (Simulation Mode) without hardware.
- Manual Checklist:
  - Follow docs/markdown/System_Test_Checklist.md to validate FR2, FR3/NFR2, FR5, FR8, FR10, and Endurance.

## Performance & Endurance Testing
- Simulated load with multiple clients:
  - python scripts/run_performance_test.py --clients 8 --rate 30 --duration 900
  - Monitors CPU/Memory; verifies NetworkController stability under load.

## Post-Session Sync Validation
- Validate cross-device timing (FR3/NFR2):
  - python scripts/validate_sync.py --session <PATH_TO_SESSION_FOLDER>
  - PASS: |Δt| < 5 ms across compared streams.



## Repository Hygiene
- Do not commit machine-specific files like local.properties (already covered by .gitignore). If one appears in VCS, remove it from version control and keep it local-only.
- Keep build artifacts out of Git: Gradle .gradle/, **/build/, Android .cxx/, and Python caches/venvs are ignored via the root .gitignore.
- Prefer adding new ignore patterns to the root .gitignore rather than project-specific files to maintain a single source of truth.
- Before committing, run tests (pytest for PC, Gradle unit tests for Android) to avoid breaking main.
